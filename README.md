DUNGEON MAN
-----------
A rogue-like, java based game, using libGDX.
Runs on Linux and Windows. Use **WASD** to move and use **Left Mouse Button** and **Right Mouse Button** to attack in the direction of the mouse with either of your two weapons. Press **Esc** to pause the game and bring up the menu and **E** to interact with the shop and doors (Only when all enemies have been defeated).


To run:  
- Make sure you have Gradle installed.  
- Open the folder's location in terminal.  

On Linux:
```
gradle run
```
or on Windows:
```
gradlew.bat run
```

Note: On Windows, `gradle run` only sometimes works. It seems it has the best chance when ran from `dungeon-game` folder. Occasionally a gradle build error will occur where one of the files cannot be read. Attempting to run `gradle run` again appears to resolve this.

The game should then hopefully run :)
